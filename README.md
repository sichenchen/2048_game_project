Description
This project is a simple, text-based version of the popular 2048 puzzle game. In this game, players move numbers in a 4x4 grid, combining tiles with the same values to create higher numbers. The goal is to reach the 2048 tile.

Features
Initializes a 4x4 grid with two "2" tiles in random positions.
Allows players to move tiles in four directions (up, down, left, right).
Adds a new "2" tile after every valid move.
Checks for winning (2048 tile) and losing conditions (no moves left).
User input validation and error handling.

Usage
Use w, a, s, d keys to move tiles:
w: Move Up
a: Move Left
s: Move Down
d: Move Right
The game will automatically add a new "2" tile after each move.
The game ends when you either reach the 2048 tile or there are no more possible moves.
